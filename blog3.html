                            <h4>7 Cheap Indonesian Web Hosts in 2019</h4>
                            <p class="pt-2">There are lots of cheap web hosting out there, which even offer prices of Rp. 5,000 / month. But are you sure that cheap web hosting can support your needs? I know that many websites and blogs can work well on cheap hosting
                                packages, but when you are looking for a cheap web host, of course you also don't want a web host with "cheap services" too, right?
                            </p>
                            <p>Here are 7 Cheap Indonesian Web Hosts in 2019</p>
                            <p class="p-header">1. Jetorbit - Cheap Hosting with the Best Performance</p>
                            <p>This web hosting company is based in Sleman, Yogyakarta and has been operating since 2012. For those of you who are familiar with the world of websites, you might only hear the name because it is still relatively new.</p>
                            <p>But make no mistake, although it is rather new, Jetorbit can be an option for those of you who intend to build a blog / website.</p>
                            <p> Jetorbit is a web hosting service provider with pretty good performance but at a very affordable price.</p>
                            <p>Not much info can be explored because even though it has been operating for almost 8 years, they don't even include an 'About Us' page on their official website.

                            <p>ArdHosting is probably the oldest hosting in Indonesia. They have been established since 2000.</p>
                            <p>It must be recognized that they are the most experienced services in the Indonesian web hosting industry.</p>
                            <p>But, has its experience for almost 2 decades made ArdHosting the best hosting in Indonesia?
                            </p>
                            <p>Unfortunately no.</p>
                            <p>The average active and loading time of ArdHosting is good, but fails on the Load Impact factor.</p>
                            <p> Another disadvantage is that ArdHosting only provides a guarantee for 7 days where a standard warranty in the web hosting industry must be given a minimum of 30 days.</p>

                            <p>Dapur Hosting has been established since 2005. Most of you probably already know it. They are quite popular in Indonesia. So, no wonder the information that I got from the HostAdvice site is that they are included in the top
                                10 hosting companies with the most clients in Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>Dapur Hosting not only has a server with a stable average uptime (99.93%), but also a record of average page load time which is quite good, which is 1.04 seconds. Plus, they also have pretty good support.</p>
